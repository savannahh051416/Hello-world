  # Hello-world
 My name is Savannah...Wild Native Michigan Girl. Mother of two, gypsy minded. 
 Newly widowed, as in he might as well be Dead....2 me
 I am 18 days away from being twenty-five years old!!!
                         {{12-20-1994}}
 How has so much time slipped thru the cracks? Noticed by everyone and everything but me! 
 My oldest child will be FOUR this upcoming May, and my Owen can speak in sentences!
 It's just us, learning to be three, instead of four. Blessed to be their mama.
